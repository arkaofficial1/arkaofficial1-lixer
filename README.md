# URL Shortener Project

## üöÄ Project Overview

This is a modern, full-stack URL shortening service built with Next.js. It allows users to quickly and easily shorten long URLs, manage their created links, and potentially track click analytics.

**Key Features:**

*   **Efficient URL Shortening:** Convert long URLs into concise, shareable links.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure user accounts for managing links (signup, login).
*   **Link Management:** Users can view, edit, and delete their shortened links.
*   **Localization Support:** Includes Persian (ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å) language support.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (React Framework), Tailwind CSS (for styling)
*   **Backend:** Node.js, [Mention your specific backend setup if applicable, e.g., Express.js, Next.js API Routes]
*   **Database:** [Mention your database, e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Firebase Firestore]
*   **Deployment:** [Mention your deployment platform if known, e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Firebase Hosting]
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Implemented using JSON language files (like `messages/fa.json`).

##  Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended) installed
*   npm or yarn package manager
*   [Mention any database setup required, e.g., a running MongoDB instance, Firebase project setup]

## üì¶ Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
2.  **Install dependencies:**
3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your environment variables. This typically includes database connection strings, API keys, etc.
*Note: Replace `<your_database_connection_string>` and `<a_long_random_string>` with your actual values.*

4.  **Run database migrations (if applicable):**

    If your project uses a database schema and migration tools:
5.  **Run the development server:**
The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìñ Usage

Once the application is running:

1.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  [**For anonymous users:**] You can typically find an input field on the homepage to paste a long URL and get a shortened one instantly.
3.  [**For registered users:**] Navigate to the signup page (`/signup`) to create an account, or the login page (`/login`) if you already have one.
4.  After logging in, you should have access to a dashboard where you can view, create, and manage your shortened links.
5.  To switch the language (if the UI allows), look for a language switcher element (often a dropdown or flag icon). Based on your `messages/fa.json`, Persian is supported.
